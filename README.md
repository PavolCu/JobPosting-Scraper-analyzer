# JobPosting-Scraper-analyzer

What about a program that can read job postings, and get and use data from them?
The app can produce a summary based on the user's settings or even some statistics
It can be "just" a console app and/or you can create desktop/web/mobile UI as well
Ideally, something that can make searching for a job easier
